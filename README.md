# Import SD card pictures and videos

No√© Aubin-Cadot

This Python script is meant to import the pictures and videos from a SD card to a computer using Python.
For now, it only imports the content of a SD card used in a Sony camera and the script was only tested on macOS.

Things that could be implemented in the future:
- Import MP4 videos also and not only the AVCHD/MTS files.
- Import SD cards from Canon, Nikon, Pentax, etc., with folders structures other than Sony.
- Automate the conversion of MTS files to MP4 via ffmpeg.
